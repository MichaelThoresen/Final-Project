This page will be tailored to the individual by using the information they provided in their profile by excluding the jobs which has jobs far outside their field of expertise. You can further narrow the selection by utilizing the window on the left hand side of the window where you can search for specific positions and choose to include only part time or full time jobs. We envision it will look like this:</p>
