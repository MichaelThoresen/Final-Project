    	<p>Youth unemployment is a major problem in many countries. A youth is defined by the United Nations (https://www.un.org/) as a person between 15 and 24 years of age. 
		An unemployed person is defined as someone who does not have a job, but is actively seeking work. In order to qualify as unemployed for official and statistical measurement, 
		the individual must be without employment, willing and able to work, of the officially designated 'working age' and actively searching for a position. 
		Youth unemployment rates tend to be higher than the adult rates in every country in the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_unemployment">Learn more.</a></p>
    	<p>The general economic situation in the world has had a major impact on youth unemployment. For example: 4 September 2012 – Unemployment rates among young people will get even worse
